                <img id="me" src="C:/Users/aplee/Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/profile.png" alt="Alex Lee"> I'm Alex. I have backgrounds in Pre-Hopsital Medicine, In-Hospital Patient Care Services, Standby Event
                Emergency Services, Security/Event Management, Education, and Law Enforcement. I began to get involved in
                technology in 2017 as I was serving as an educator for EMTs and Paramedics. I use principles from the National
                Association of EMS Educators to teach cognitive, affective, and kinesthetic skills with a strong emphasis
                on professional growth and adapting to new technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated from UC Davis in 2008, Sacramento Police Academy in 2010, University of Nevada: Reno - REMSA Paramedic Program
                in 2015, and I'm currently attending UC Davis Extension's Coding Boot Camp with an expected graduation date
                of November 17, 2018.
            </p>

            <p>
                I live and work in Sacramento where I enjoy teaching basic marksmanship, hiking, fishing, and finding new places to eat ice
                cream with friends.
